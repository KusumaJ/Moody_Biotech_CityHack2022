## Description of the Project 
According to Sigmond Freud, a person has conscious and unconscious level thoughts. Unconscious level thought might not be apparent to most; it's responsible for the "gut feeling" or undermining mental condition.
The project aims to create an application that allows users to track and interpret dreams, similar to how therapists have utilized recurring patterns or themes to understand each individual's needs better and serve as a preliminary diagnosis of mental illnesses. Users can input their dream in various ways; the algorithm will analyze patterns, report back the theme and overall mood, and simultaneously analyze for signs of mental issues. With sufficient data from the users, the summary could help highlight frequently found topics to assist self-realization. In addition, short questionnaires would be prompted if the pattern is deemed to be significantly associated with mental health problems and offer suggestions for the need to consult an expert.
